    <p class="MsoNormal">I was born in 1980 in Brisbane, Australia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>My parents are Scottish and English, one a direct immigrant and
      the other a first generation Australian.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">I've lived most of my life in Queensland and just
      recently (end of 2018) moved to Tasmania to open a business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">I have previously worked in the IT industry, having
      worked for over a decade as an executive on a Domain Name Registrar, a
      Drop Catcher, A PPC search engine and an Affiliate Network. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>During
      this role I picked up some technical skill in mySQL and basic front-end
      Development, however I would really like to expand this and become a real
      technical expert. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">An interesting fact about me is that after I left the
      IT industry a couple of years ago I decided to try a completely different
      industry and I moved to Tasmania to open my very own Laser Clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We perform permanent laser hair removal, skin treatments and even
      cosmetic injectables like anti-wrinkle and filler. </p>
    <p>Besides work, I love hiking, camping, renovating, motorbikes and dogs.<span
